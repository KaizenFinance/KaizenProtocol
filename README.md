# KaizenProtocol
Kaizen Protocol brief description

To overcome the deficiencies of existing procedures to implement decentralized finance pools, we
introduce a new open-source transactional DeFi protocol – the KAIZEN protocol suite. In Japanese
business philosophy, the term kaizen (改善), literally change-good, is broadly interpreted to mean
continuous improvement or “improvement in productivity.”

Like its namesake, the KAIZEN protocol suite was developed to sustainably improve DeFi
transactional proficiency and financial performance by addressing cost and trade inefficiencies and
operational risks plaguing other protocols and DeFi trading pools.

The goals of the KAIZEN protocol suite for delivering rational DeFi transactions are many but include:
• Conveniently enabling common DeFi pool transactions including digital asset swapping,
lending (staking), secured borrowing, and liquidity providing.
• Facilitating transactional processing for DeFi trading pools comprising a wide variety of
token types such as tokenized cryptocurrency (wraps), index tokens, synthetic tokens and
platform tokens (i.e. governance tokens, infrastructure tokens, and project tokens).
• Facilitating transactional processing for enterprises issuing new token offerings of
enterprise tokens and derivatives thereof (proxy tokens), including mechanisms for token
minting, founder/seed token contracts, scheduled unlocking, DCX/DEX distribution, air
drops, swap pools, and private placement pools.
• Reducing pool costs by scanning market pools and exchanges and dynamically identifying
the best investment opportunities and returns for a specific token.
• Reducing pool costs by avoiding unnecessary sequential transactions (multi-swaps) and
associated fees in order to trade a specific token-pair.
• Reducing trading costs by forecasting the optimum timing opportunity to execute a
transaction at a lower price or at a specified target cost.
• Mitigating liquidity-provider risk of divergent loss exposure to arbitrage by monitoring the
current trading price of a token across related DeFi pools and avoiding outlier transactions.
• Integrating AI-based decentralized oracle dApp capability to prevent unawareness risks
leading to suboptimal yield farming and price manipulation exposure.
• Discouraging tampering such as pump-and-dump price manipulation of DeFi trading by
executing rational tokenomic price-bonding models resilient to market manipulation.
• Simplifying the DeFi web interface to streamline trading, improve information clarity, and
enhance user experience (improved UI/UX).
• Seamlessly integrating the KAIZEN protocol suite and UI/UX with hypersecure crypto
wallets employing HYPERID identity validation technology, creating an integrated one-stop
platform for DeFi trading and investing.

In simple terms, the mission of the KAIZEN protocol suite is to deliver an easy-to-use transactional
platform and methodology for the timely execution of cost-efficient token trading within DeFi
pools, free from excessive fees, tampering, irrational pricing, and divergent loss exposure.

To accomplish these ambitious goals, KAIZEN operates as a decentralized application (dApp) in
the cloud facilitating fully-transparent DeFi pools with open access and permissionless
participation. The KAIZEN protocol suite is cross-chain compatible, agnostic to the tokens it trades
and to the networks and dApp virtual machines (VMs) hosting its smart contracts.

Replacing the role of a central authority (banks, financial, and governmental institutions) with an
open-source protocol transparently executed on a public unitary blockchain (such as the Ethereum
blockchain), KAIZEN is able to deliver to investors what other protocols cannot – transactional
integrity and economic trust in a trustless environment.

By transparently delivering verifiable transactional integrity, KAIZEN empowers traders, investors,
and liquidity providers the ability to engage in (or create their own) DeFi pools, emulating the
services of a bank without ceding financial control to the self-interest of institutional shareholders
or to unscrupulous, disingenuous, and politically-motivated regulatory authorities.
